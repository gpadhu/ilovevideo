Video Gallery
Create a video gallery page (e.g. ilovevideo.tv) using infinite scroll and any of following features;
Use any flash or html5 player framework (with an explanation why you chose if any) or simple html elements.
Use any UI library, framework (with an explanation why you chose if any) or pure javascript, html, css.
Use ES6 and/or babeljs and/or ES5.
Load clips partially when user clicks on a load more button or reaches through the end of the existing list.
Use static js/json data or any RESTful framework or tool (with an explanation why you chose if any). E.g. MongoDB in memory datasource with LoopbackJS.
Automatically play the video clip which fits in viewport first/best. like ilovevideo.tv
Keep layout responsive as much as possible.
Logging video events via console like 'ad started', 'ad finished', 'content started', 'content finished'.
Style by your own taste.
Sample clip load and model might be as following;
"clips": [{
  "title": "Clip Title 1",
  "thumbnail": "freeze_frame_10/46/95/27_304194_20160613-EM-Sieg-Postings-mp4.jpg",
  "stream": {
    "protocol": "rtmp", 
    "streamer": "fms.edge.cdn.castaclip.net", 
    "file": "format_x405/05/17/27_670639_5D01B363-0CE9-ED2E-9C2A05093C20C2B7-500k-mp4.mp4"
